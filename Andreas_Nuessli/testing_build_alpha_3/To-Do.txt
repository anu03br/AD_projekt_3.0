CSV import
# works but "JoÃ«l" is not converted to "Joel"

1a - Done
# if any groupname is "" this fails
            AddToGroup -GroupName "$($user.Klasse)" -SAM "$($user.Benutzername)"
            AddToGroup -GroupName "$($user.Klasse2)" -SAM "$($user.Benutzername)"
#build in check if empty
## Added check 
if ([string]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace($GroupName))
to function AddToGroup
#It now works as intended

1b
works

2a
    #this sleeps the whole console - find a better way
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 86400  # Warte 24 Stunden = 86400 Sekunden
# this is basically a never ending loop with sleeps in between
# we can't just freeze the whole app for a day, maybe like get-datetime and if datetime= 12:00 do stuff idk

-proposed solution: when 2a is called you can activate and set the timer to any time of day (set value in config to 1).
when MainMenue is called it will check if $config.backup = 1. if true it will start the logging process.
this way the function is 1. menuedriven 2. automated

-if possible we could also divert all error messages to a seperate log.

2b - done

!nice but can we have a menue so I can input a samaccountname and the do as many things as i want
then push a number to get back to main menue.

!you can still input bogus usernames but it is caugth when calling any subfunction. no red errors.

## Added while Loop so you can now do things until you choose 5 in menue (back to main menue)
# added option to change user while in submenue

#
2c

it just works.

Don't forget to check for changes function names at the end.

Seems to work sometimes with -encoding UTF8 and sometimes with -encoding latin1
whats up with that

config

when you're done testing change the variables for the csv back. also figure out a variable name for the changed csv.
